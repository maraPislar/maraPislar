# Hi there, I'm (Theodora-)Mara 👋

Welcome! I'm passionate about the intersection between causal inference and ML, sequential decision making, AI for science and of course, playing with the GenAI models. I enjoy exploring how to get the most out of my data from different fields, from political discourse and social media messages, to environmental and medical data. Data these days seems limitless, so might as well take advantage of that.
