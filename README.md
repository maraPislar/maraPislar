# Hi there, I'm Mara 👋

**Machine Learning Engineer & Researcher**
*Bridging the gap between Causal Inference and production-scale AI.*

Currently, I work as a **Data Scientist at INGKA Group (IKEA)**, architecting the recommendations infrastructure serving millions of users. My focus is on building reliable, interpretable systems, whether that's deploying Multi-Armed Bandits in **Golang** or mapping the internal reasoning of LLMs.

### 🚀 Highlights

- **🏆 Oral Presentation at CLeaR 2025:** My paper on *Causal Abstraction in Large Language Models* was selected for an oral presentation. I study *how* models reason, not just what they predict.
- **🛠 Production RL at Scale:** Shift to dynamic **Multi-Armed Bandit agents**
- **🔎 Offline Simulation:** Designed the evaluation framework that allows to test agent safety and convergence before live deployment.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, Golang, SQL
- **Machine Learning:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Reinforcement Learning (Bandits)
- **LLMs & GenAI:** Hugging Face (Transformers, PEFT), LangChain, OpenAI API
- **Causal Inference:** DoWhy, CausalML
- **Infrastructure:** Google Cloud Platform (Vertex AI, BigQuery)

### 📚 Selected Research & Projects

- **[Combining Causal Models for Accurate NN Abstractions](https://github.com/maraPislar/combining-causal-models-for-accurate-NN-abstractions)** *Accepted for Oral Presentation at CLeaR 2025.* Investigating the mechanistic interpretability of GPT-2 through causal abstractions.
  
- **[Reproducibility Study: Label-Free Explainability](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sF_vYZSxSV)** Published reproducibility study on unsupervised model explainability.

- **[Romanian Political Discourse Analysis](LINK_IF_YOU_HAVE_IT)** *In Progress.* Analyzing the discourse of politicians in official meetings using NLP techniques.
